Welcome to your DeFi Kingdom Clone! This guide will walk you through the setup process step by step to ensure a smooth and successful deployment of your game environment.

## Setting up Your EVM Subnet

First things first, let's establish your EVM subnet on the Avalanche network. Refer to our detailed guide along with the Avalanche documentation to create a customized EVM subnet tailored to your game's requirements.

## Defining Your Native Currency

Next, define your native currency which will serve as the backbone of your in-game economy. This currency will empower users to engage in various transactions within your DeFi Kingdom clone.

## Connecting to Metamask

Seamlessly integrate your EVM Subnet with Metamask to enable smooth user interactions. Follow our comprehensive instructions to connect Metamask to your subnet, allowing players to effortlessly access your game using their Metamask wallets.

## Deploying Basic Building Blocks

Now, let's deploy the fundamental components of your game using Solidity and Remix. These building blocks, including smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading, will lay the foundation for your game's mechanics and rules.

### Deployment Steps:

1. Utilize the Avalanche CLI to deploy your EVM subnet.
2. Add your subnet to Metamask and ensure it's the selected network.
3. Connect Remix to Metamask using the Injected Provider.
4. Deploy your smart contracts.

## Testing Your Application

Before launching your game to the world, it's crucial to thoroughly test its functionality. Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts, deploy tokens, liquidity pools, and more. Testing ensures a seamless user experience and identifies any potential issues early on.

Congratulations on reaching this stage of your DeFi Kingdom Clone setup! Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of decentralized finance gaming. Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€
